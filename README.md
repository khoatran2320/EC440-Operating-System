These projects received full points for their respective assessments, but there's no guarantee that they are completely correct. 

### Project 1: Simple Shell
The purpose of this project is to build a simple shell to showcase understanding of system calls. Concepts in the project include
-   signals
-   standard file descriptors
-   cross-process communication
-   process cloning
-   process task replacement
-   input string parsing

### Project 2: Threading Library
The purpose of this project is to build a user-space threading library that supports a threading API similar to the pthread standard. Concepts in the project include
-   scheduling (especially round robin)
-   signals
-   register manipulation
-   stack frame manipulation
-   thread-state management

### Project 3: Thread Synchronization
The purpose of this project is to build the threading library in project 2 to support thread synchronization. Concepts in the project include
-   signal management
-   thread state-dependent scheduling
-   mutex
-   barrier

### Project 4: Thread Local Storage
The purpose of this project is to provide a mechanism for threads to store information that offers protection from other threads. Concepts in the project include
-   memory management
-   memory pages
-   page protections
-   copy on write

### Project 5: File Systems
The purpose of this project is to build a file system. Since this project does not run in the kernel, it actually runs on a Linux file system. Concepts in the project include
-   disk management
-   inodes
-   indirect block mapping
-   bit manipulation
